To disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 on a Windows machine, you'll need to modify the SSL/TLS configuration in the Windows registry. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open Registry Editor**: Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog, type `regedit`, and press Enter. This will open the Registry Editor.

2. **Navigate to the SSL/TLS Configuration**: In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following registry key:

   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols
   ```

3. **Locate TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 Subkeys**: Under the "Protocols" key, you should see subkeys named `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.1`. If they don't exist, you'll need to create them.

   - Right-click on the "Protocols" key.
   - Choose `New` > `Key`.
   - Name the new key `TLS 1.0`.
   - Repeat the process to create a `TLS 1.1` key.

4. **Configure TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 Subkeys**: Within each of the `TLS 1.0` and `TLS 1.1` subkeys, create the following DWORD values (if they don't already exist) and set their values to `0x00000000`:

   - `DisabledByDefault`: Set to `1` to disable TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1.
   - `Enabled`: Set to `0` to disable TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1.

5. **Restart the System**: After making changes to the registry, it's recommended to restart the system to ensure that the changes take effect.

6. **Test Connectivity**: After restarting, test the applications or services that rely on SSL/TLS connections to ensure they're still accessible and functioning correctly. Ensure that they're using TLS 1.2 or later as intended.

By following these steps, you can effectively disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 on your Windows machine, helping to improve security by ensuring that only the latest and most secure SSL/TLS protocols are used for communication.
